I hail from Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, China, a place steeped in rich cultural heritage and renowned mythological tales, earning it the title of 'Homeland of Chinese Mythology.' I pursued my undergraduate studies at North University of China, specializing in the fields of automatic control theory and embedded systems. In the year 2020, I successfully obtained my Bachelor's degree, establishing a robust foundation for my professional journey.
Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree at Nanjing Normal University, focusing my research endeavors on human behavior recognition, ubiquitous computing, and deep learning. I am privileged to be a research scholar under the guidance of Associate Professor Zhang Lei, an expert in this domain, who provides invaluable mentorship and opportunities.
Deep learning has consistently captured my profound interest, particularly in the realms of object detection and image generation. I am driven to attain an in-depth understanding and mastery of these technologies, with the aspiration of making meaningful contributions to future research and applications.
Furthermore, I am an avid enthusiast of physical activities, with a particular passion for street dancing. Engaging in sports not only promotes physical well-being but also nurtures my teamwork and creativity, qualities of equal importance in the fields of research and academia.
