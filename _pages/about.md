## Biography

I originate from Changzhi City, located in Shanxi Province, China, a region steeped in profound cultural heritage and renowned mythological narratives, earning it the esteemed title of the 'Homeland of Chinese Mythology.' My academic journey commenced at North University of China, where I diligently pursued my undergraduate studies, specializing in the domains of automatic control theory and embedded systems. In the year 2020, I successfully earned my Bachelor's degree, laying a resilient foundation for my ensuing professional endeavors.

Currently, I am immersed in the pursuit of a Master's degree at Nanjing Normal University, where my research thrusts are meticulously focused on the fields of human behavior recognition, ubiquitous computing, and deep learning. I am privileged to serve as a research scholar under the esteemed guidance of Associate Professor Zhang Lei, a distinguished expert in this domain, whose mentorship provides invaluable insights and opportunities.

My profound interest has consistently gravitated towards the intricate domain of deep learning, with a specific emphasis on the areas of object detection and image generation. I ardently endeavor to acquire an exhaustive understanding and mastery of these cutting-edge technologies, with the aspiration of making substantial contributions to future research and practical applications.

Furthermore, I am a passionate enthusiast of physical activities, harboring a distinct ardor for the art of street dancing. Engaging in sports not only nurtures my physical well-being but also cultivates my prowess in teamwork and creativityâ€”qualities of paramount significance in the realms of scholarly research and academia.
