I come from Changzhi City in Shanxi Province, China, known for its rich cultural heritage and legendary tales. I began my academic journey at North University of China, specializing in automatic control theory and embedded systems. In 2020, I earned my Bachelor's degree, laying the foundation for my career. Now, I'm pursuing a Master's degree at Nanjing Normal University, focusing on human behavior recognition, ubiquitous computing, and deep learning. I'm fortunate to be a research scholar under Associate Professor Zhang Lei, an expert in this field. I'm passionate about deep learning, particularly in object detection and image generation, aiming to contribute to future research and practical applications. Besides academics, I'm enthusiastic about street dancing and believe it fosters teamwork and creativity, valuable qualities in both sports and academia.
